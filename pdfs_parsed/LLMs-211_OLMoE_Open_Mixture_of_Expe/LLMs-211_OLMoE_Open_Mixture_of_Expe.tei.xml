<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LMs) on various tasks, there remains a clear trade-off between performance and cost in both training and inference. High-performing LMs are inaccessible for many academics and open-source developers as they are prohibitively expensive to build and deploy.</p><p><ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> One approach to improve the cost-performance trade-off lies in using sparselyactivated Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Shazeer et al., 2017)</ref>. MoEs have several experts in each layer, only a subset of which is activated at a time (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">C1</ref>). This makes MoEs significantly more efficient than dense models with a similar number of total parameters, which activate all parameters for every input <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">(Yun et al., 2024)</ref>. For this reason, industry frontier models use MoEs including Gemini-1.5 <ref type="bibr">(Team et al., 2024a)</ref> and reportedly <ref type="bibr">GPT-4 (Chintala, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Most MoE models, however, are closed-source: While some have publicly released model weights <ref type="bibr">(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jiang et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Shen et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Team et al., 2024d;</ref><ref type="bibr">Team, 2024b)</ref>, they offer limited to no information about their training data, code, or recipes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). While there have been prior efforts to make language modeling research fully accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Biderman et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Groeneveld et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al., 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Liu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Workshop et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2024a)</ref> discussed in detail in Appendix A, they have been largely limited to dense LMs. This comes despite MoEs requiring more openness as they add complex new design questions to LMs, such as how many total versus active parameters to use, whether to use many small or few large experts, if experts should be shared, and what routing algorithm to use. The lack of open resources and findings about these details prevents the field from building cost-efficient open MoEs that approach the capabilities of closed-source frontier models.</p><p>To address these issues, we introduce OLMOE, a fully open Mixture-of-Experts language model with state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized models. In particular, we pretrain OLMOE-1B-7B for 5.1 trillion tokens with 6.9B total parameters, of which only 1.3B are activated for each input token. This leads to a similar inference cost as using dense models with around 1B parameters, such as OLMo 1B <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Groeneveld et al., 2024)</ref> or TinyLlama 1B <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al., 2024b)</ref>, but requires more GPU memory to store its 7B total parameters. Our experiments show that MoEs train ∼2× faster than dense LMs with equivalent active parameters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, we show that OLMOE-1B-7B significantly outperforms all open 1B models and displays competitive performance to dense models with significantly higher inference costs and memory storage (e.g., similar MMLU scores to Llama2-13B, which is ∼10× more costly). Via instruction-and preference tuning, we create OLMOE-1B-7B-INSTRUCT, which we find exceeds various larger instruct models including Llama2-13B-Chat <ref type="bibr">(Touvron et al., 2023b)</ref>, OLMo-7B-Instruct (0724), and DeepSeekMoE-16B <ref type="bibr">(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024a)</ref> on common benchmarks <ref type="bibr">(MMLU,</ref><ref type="bibr">GSM8k,</ref><ref type="bibr">HumanEval,</ref><ref type="bibr">etc.)</ref>.</p><p>Our comprehensive set of controlled experiments highlights key design choices for MoEs (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) and LMs in general. One critical design decision for making MoEs performant is using fine-grained routing with granular experts <ref type="bibr">(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024a)</ref>: we employ 64 small experts in each layer with 8 being activated. The choice of routing algorithm is also important: we find dropless <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gale et al., 2022)</ref> token-based routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Shazeer et al., 2017)</ref> outperforms expert-based routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Zhou et al., 2022)</ref>. Our findings also include those that challenge prior work, such as the ineffectiveness of shared experts <ref type="bibr">(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024a)</ref> and the limited benefits of sparsely upcycling a pretrained dense LM into an MoE <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Komatsuzaki et al., 2023)</ref> unless under small compute budgets. Finally, we present novel ways to analyze routing behavior in Mixture-of-Experts finding that for OLMOE-1B-7B routing saturates early in pretraining, experts are rarely co-activated, and experts exhibit domain and vocabulary specialization. We intend our fully open MoE to facilitate more research and analysis to improve our understanding of these models. We release training code, intermediate checkpoints (every 5000 steps), training logs, and training data under opensource licenses (Apache 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 or ODC-By 1.0 https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/).</p></div>

We describe our adaptation datasets in Table <ref type="table">C2</ref> and hyperparameters in Appendix C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>Our evaluation procedure consists of three parts: During pretraining (Appendix F), After pretraining, and After adaptation. We detail the setup for each in Appendix D.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref>: OLMOE-1B-7B after pretraining. We compare with LMs of similar active parameters (1B, approximating speed and cost) or total parameters (7B, approximating memory). Model names include rounded parameter counts: model-active-total for MoEs and model-total for dense LMs (leading to differences from official names, e.g., "Gemma2-2B" has 2.6B active and total parameters <ref type="bibr">(Team et al., 2024c)</ref>). We run all evaluations ourselves with 5 few-shots (Appendix D). having &gt;2× more parameters and its pretrained model outperforming OLMOE-1B-7B in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. The 84% score on AlpacaEval also outperforms much larger dense models on the leaderboard <ref type="bibr">(Li et al., 2023b)</ref>, such as Llama2-13B-Chat <ref type="bibr">(Touvron et al., 2023b)</ref>.    <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Fedus et al., 2022)</ref> train 2-7× faster but for encoder-decoder models while the other works study decoder-only LMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, we compare MoEs and dense models in a controlled setup. We find that our MoE reaches the performance of the dense model with ∼3× fewer tokens equivalent to ∼3× less compute measured in FLOPs. However, due to the additional memory overhead of training the MoE with its 7B total parameters, it processes fewer tokens per second than the dense model (23,600 tokens per second per GPU for the MoE vs. 37,500 for dense). Thus, in terms of training time, it reaches the performance of the dense model only ∼2× faster. There are likely optimizations possible that would bring the speed-up closer to the 3× token speed-up, which we leave to future work. Based on these results, we select an MoE configuration with 6.9B total and 1.3B active parameters matching OLMo-7B in total and OLMo-1B in active parameter count, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Groeneveld et al., 2024)</ref>. We provide more reasons for this configuration in Appendix J.</p><p>4.2 EXPERT GRANULARITY <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Dai et al. (2024)</ref> propose to use small fine-grained experts to allow more combinations of experts and thus make the model more flexible. For example, the Mixtral model <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Jiang et al., 2024)</ref> uses the common configuration of 8 experts per layer, 2 of which are activated. This allows for ( 8 2 ) = 28 combinations per layer. By halving the size of each expert and therefore doubling the number of experts to maintain the same compute and parameter budget, we can increase the possible combinations to ( 16 4 ) = 1, 820. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Krajewski et al. (2024)</ref> investigate compute-optimal granularity configurations finding that higher compute budgets warrant more granular experts. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tokens (B)</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Expert granularity. We vary the number of experts in tandem with the FFN dimension to ensure that active and total parameters and thus compute cost remain the same. For example, for 64 experts, the FFN dimension is 1,024 and 8 experts are active, while for 32 experts it is 2,048 with 4 active experts. More results, logs, and configurations: https://wandb.ai/ai2-llm/olmoe/ reports/Plot-Granularity--Vmlldzo4OTIxOTE4</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we observe that more granular experts improve training loss, validation loss, and downstream performance. The 8-expert configuration uses 1 active expert, which yields ( 8 1 ) = 8 combinations. By quartering the size of each expert but increasing the number to 32 with 4 active ones (( 32 4 ) = 35, 960 combinations), we observe an improvement of around 10% on HellaSwag and MMLU at around 130 billion tokens. However, we find that there are diminishing returns to granularity. The additional increase to 64 experts with 8 active ones (( 64 8 ) = 4, 426, 165, 368 combinations) improves downstream metrics by a smaller amount of 1-2%. For our OLMOE-1B-7B compute budget<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> of 3 × 10 22 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Krajewski et al. (2024)</ref> predict an optimal number of experts of 256 (G = 32 in their paper). However, their predictions are for compute-optimal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Hoffmann et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Clark et al., 2022)</ref>, while we train for 5T tokens, which is orders of magnitude beyond what would be conventionally considered optimal for our model size. Thus, their predictions may not extend to our setup, and we stick with 64 experts for OLMOE-1B-7B , also due to the diminishing returns in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. </p></div>

For TC, 2 experts are activated per token, while for EC the capacity factor is 2. Thus, both models use the same number of active parameters. More results, logs, and configurations: https: //wandb.ai/ai2-llm/olmoe/reports/Plot-EC-vs-TC--Vmlldzo4MzkzMDM3</p><p>The MoE router determines which experts process each input token ( §2). There are two common types <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2024b)</ref>: expert choice (EC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Zhou et al., 2022)</ref> and token choice (TC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Shazeer et al., 2017)</ref>. For EC, each expert selects a fixed number of tokens per sequence. By design, this leads to each expert processing the same number of tokens. This is the main benefit of EC as it ensures perfect load balance, which improves training throughput and removes the need for a load balancing loss. The main issue of EC is that it is impractical for autoregressive generation where a single token is processed at each step rather than the entire sequence in one <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Raposo et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Another potential downside is EC can lead to token dropping, where some tokens are not selected by any expert, which can hurt performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gale et al., 2022)</ref>. At the same time, it can lead to some tokens being processed by multiple experts, which could also be beneficial as it allows the model to allocate more compute to some tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Zhou et al., 2022)</ref>. For TC, each token selects a fixed number of experts. This can lead to many tokens choosing the same expert, hurting training efficiency. Thus, TC is often used with a load balancing loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Shazeer et al., 2017)</ref> to encourage equal distribution.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, we benchmark EC and TC. We find that TC outperforms EC for the same token budget for all tasks depicted. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Zhou et al. (2022)</ref> find EC to be better, our configuration slightly differs in that we use dropless MoEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gale et al., 2022)</ref> with a load balancing loss. Thus, our TC variant is expected to perform better than the TC variant in <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Zhou et al. (2022)</ref>. We confirm findings that EC runs around 20% faster at 29,400 tokens per second per device versus 24,400 for TC <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Zhou et al., 2022)</ref>. EC may be more beneficial in a multimodal setup <ref type="bibr">(Lin et al., 2024b)</ref> as dropping noisy image tokens is likely less harmful than text tokens. Thus, while we stick with TC for this release of OLMOE , we may revisit EC for future multimodal models.</p></div>

We compute saturation by comparing the routing to the top-k experts at four intermediate checkpoints <ref type="bibr">(1, 10, 20, and 40% of pretraining)</ref> to the final pretraining checkpoint (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>). corresponds to whether the router weights are still learning which expert will process certain data. A value of 100% indicates that the router at the intermediate checkpoint will route to the same experts as the final checkpoint router. See §H.1 for the detailed formula used to calculate the value.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that, after 1% of pretraining, up to ∼60% of routing to the top-8 activated experts has already saturated (right). Thus the model already uses the same 8 experts for given input data as it will at the end of pretraining. This early saturation aligns with prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Xue et al., 2024)</ref>. At 40% of pretraining, saturation reaches up to ∼80%. However, which top-1 expert has the highest routing probability saturates slower (left). We find that routing in later layers saturates earlier during pretraining. Layer 0 is an outlier saturating significantly more slowly than other layers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Dai et al. (2024)</ref> do not use an MoE in the first layer as they find that load balancing converges more slowly for the first layer. This is likely linked to our findings on saturation. Because routing in the first layer saturates slower, the experts that certain input data get routed to frequently change. These changes may lead to one expert suddenly getting significantly more data than others thereby impairing load balancing. We are excited about future work further investigating what happens in the first layer by building on our open release. Co-activation of OLMOE-1B-7B experts on a random 0.5% of the C4 validation data. We display the 32 experts with the highest maximum co-activation score via their expert IDs on the xand y-axis. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">H1</ref> for Layer 0 and 15.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">EXPERT</head><p>We define expert co-activation as the proportion of times two specific experts, E i and E j , are simultaneously activated out of the total number of activations of one of them. A co-activation of 100% indicates that if E i is activated, E j is also always activated. A value of 0% indicates that the experts never cooccur. See §H.1 for the formula used to calculate the value.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows there is no strong co-activation among experts in layer 7, with only few exceptions. This may indicate that there is little redundancy across different experts. Layers 7 and 15 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">H1</ref>) show similar co-activation patterns with several groups of 3 or 2 experts that tend to get activated together. We investigate tokens that activate these experts in §5.4. Further, in §H.2 (Figure <ref type="figure">H8</ref>), we investigate whether experts across layers, rather than within one layer, tend to process tokens together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">DOMAIN SPECIALIZATION</head><p>We define domain specialization as the specialization of expert E i to domain D, specifically the proportion of tokens from a particular domain D that get routed to a particular expert E i (see §H.1 for the formula). A value of 100% indicates that all data from that domain is routed to E i , whereas We visualize how often tokens from different domains get routed to the 64 (OLMOE) or 8 (Mixtral) experts after pretraining. We consider tokens routed to any of the k = 8 (OLMOE) or k = 2 (Mixtral) active experts (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>). Horizontal gray lines are random chance or uniform routing (8/64=12.5% per expert for OLMOE-1B-7B with 8 active out of 64 total experts per layer and 2/8=25% for Mixtral with 2 active out of 8 total experts per layer). See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">H7</ref> for k = 1 results.</p><p>0% indicates the expert is never used for that domain and can be removed from the model without affecting performance in that domain.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> (left) shows many examples of experts that are activated significantly above or below random chance for specific domains. E.g., for arXiv, which has a very specific distribution with lots of scientific text, the first expert in layer 0 is nearly 100% specialized. This suggests that there is little redundancy in the knowledge of the experts in OLMOE-1B-7B, as they specialize in different kinds of data. GitHub and arXiv are often activated together in layer 7, which we explore further in §5.4. For generic domains, such as C4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Raffel et al., 2023)</ref>, which is a web crawl containing various kinds of data, expert activations in OLMOE-1B-7B are much more balanced. This highlights that the load balancing ( §B.1.3) works as intended and the model makes proper use of all experts for generic data. Mixtral-8x7B <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Jiang et al., 2024)</ref> in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> (right), however, exhibits little domain specialization across both unique and generic domains. Experts are activated close to the uniform routing baseline for all layers and domains. Thus, there may be more redundancy across experts in Mixtral, as they likely contain similar knowledge. We hypothesize that this is due to Mixtral being upcycled from Mistral <ref type="bibr">(Cai, 2023)</ref>. The initialization from a dense model may limit the amount of possible specialization in the experts as they all start from the same local optimum. This is likely why training from scratch eventually outperforms upcycling in our pretraining experiments ( §B.1.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">VOCABULARY SPECIALIZATION</head><p>Vocabulary specialization refers to how specialized a particular expert is on a token ID x (also called a vocabulary element), defined as the proportion of tokens with a token ID x that are routed to one particular expert E i out of all experts in that layer. We distinguish input and output variants of this specialization, where x is either the input token ID or the next output token ID (either the ground-truth next token ID or the token ID predicted by the model). A value of 100% indicates that for all occurrences of that vocabulary element, input data is routed to E i , whereas 0% indicates an expert that is fully irrelevant for that vocabulary element and can be effectively removed from the model without affecting performance whenever the token ID appears.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">H2</ref> we find that vocabulary specialization is higher in later layers, similar to how later layers saturate earlier ( §5.1). Later layers also specialize more on predicted output token IDs rather than input token IDs, i.e., the routing is decided more by the token the model is about to predict rather than the original input token. This is intuitive as in earlier layers there is more uncertainty about which token the model will predict. At ∼90%, expert 27 specializes the most, which we find in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> to activate for many non-alphabetic tokens, such as Cyrillic and Devanagari letters. Expert 43 shows specialization on geographic terms in both input and output tokens. Experts 48 and 23 both focus on Table <ref type="table">4</ref>: Vocabulary specialization in the 7th layer of OLMOE-1B-7B. We use k = 1 (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_10">8</ref>) and a random 0.5% of the C4 validation data excluding token IDs with &lt;10 appearances.</p><p>Expert ID Input token IDs Predicted output token IDs</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">27 (100%) (100%) 3 (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) § (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%)</formula><p>43 Armenian (100%) ijan (100%) enia (96%)</p><p>Iraq (95%) Iranian (92%) Iran (92%) Saudi (90%) northern (90%) Lebanon (90%) Singapore (88%) Turkey (88%) enia (90%) invasion (80%) Arabia (76%) irregular (66%) regions (64%) border connector words, such as Then and Therefore . This is likely because they commonly process tokens together with a high co-activation of 60% in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Based on our findings in §5.3 that for GitHub and arXiv often the same experts in layer 7 activate, we display one such expert (expert ID 4) in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. It seems to specialize in measurements, such as sq , YR (year), and GHz . These are common terms in scientific papers corresponding to the arXiv domain and likely also in GitHub code for computations related to measurements. They are less likely to appear in books, which explains the low activation of expert ID 4 in layer 7 for book data in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>. Expert 3 is among the three most active experts of layer 7 for book data in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> (fourth yellow bar for layer 7). This resonates when looking at its specialization on family terms in Table <ref type="table">4</ref> (final row), which are far more common in books than scientific papers or code. Overall, domain specialization and vocabulary specialization are closely linked to one another, as domains are usually characterized by their distinct word distribution.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">H5</ref>, we link them more closely by comparing the extent of vocabulary specialization across domains and expert IDs. In Figure <ref type="figure">H3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">H4</ref> we also find that OLMOE-1B-7B exhibits stronger vocabulary specialization than Mixtral-8x7B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>We open-source OLMOE-1B-7B and OLMOE-1B-7B-INSTRUCT including model, data, code, and logs. At 1B active and 7B total parameters, our models yield state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar amount of active parameters even outperforming larger models including DeepSeekMoE-16B and Llama2-13B-Chat. We share ∼20 training experiments yielding novel insights into Mixture-of-Experts. Further, we define and analyze new properties of MoEs showing that OLMOE-1B-7B exhibits early router saturation, weak expert co-activation, and some evidence of domain and vocabulary specialization. We intend our fully open release to serve as a basis for more research into MoEs given their critical importance ( §1). We are excited about more iterations of OLMOE to close the gap between frontier models and fully open models. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON ALTERNATIVE DESIGN CHOICES</head><p>In this section, we present an extension of pretraining and adaptation experiments that have led to OLMOE-1B-7B (also see §4  More results, logs, and configurations: https://wandb.ai/ai2-llm/olmoe/reports/ Plot-Expert-sharing--Vmlldzo4OTIyMjQz <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Dai et al. (2024)</ref> propose training with a shared/fixed expert that is always used in addition to the routed experts. The intuition is to encourage the shared expert to learn common information and allow the other routed experts to learn more specialized knowledge. This should reduce redundancy among experts and thus lead to a better model as it can store more total information.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">B1</ref>, we benchmark having a single shared and a single routed expert versus two routed experts. While both settings lead to similar performance, sharing an expert performs slightly worse. Sharing an expert removes flexibility from the model and thus goes against the findings in §4.2 suggesting that allowing for more expert combinations improves performance. Specifically, the two models in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">B1</ref> have ( 32 4 ) = 35, 960 and ( 31 3 ) = 4, 495 possible combinations per layer. Thus, removing one of the routed experts and turning it into a shared one eliminates almost 90% of possible combinations. This likely acts as a counterforce to the potential benefits of isolating common knowledge in a shared expert. Based on these results, we do not use shared experts in OLMOE-1B-7B , but we do think that there is merit to the idea of experts that are activated more often or even always. However, rather than enforcing this behavior via a shared expert, we believe that it should be learned by the model. This is difficult with current setups due to the necessity of a load balancing loss ( §B.1.3) penalizing the model if tokens are not distributed equally among experts. Potential future work can explore removing the load balancing loss to allow for more flexible usage of experts.  <ref type="formula">0724</ref>) at 2T tokens into an MoE with 8 total experts of which 2 are activated and train it for an additional 610 billion tokens. We compare it to a model trained from scratch for 610 billion tokens. Except for this difference, both models use the same config, which includes some suboptimal settings that contribute to the instability, such as no QK-Norm ( §B.2.5) and no truncated normal init ( §B.2.2). More results, logs, and configurations: https://wandb.ai/ai2-llm/olmoe/reports/ Plot-Scratch-vs-Upcycle--Vmlldzo4NDIyOTc4 initialized router is added in front of each MoE layer. (3) Pretraining continues with the new model so that the cloned MLPs can gradually specialize in different things and the router can be learned. They find that the upcycling approach maintains a performance advantage over a language model trained from scratch for up to 120% of the compute budget of the original dense checkpoint that the sparse model was upcycled from. For example, if sparsely upcycling a 1.3B parameter model at 2 trillion tokens then only at 2.4 trillion tokens should an MoE trained from scratch catch up with the upcycled model. That is, the sparsely upcycled model would have been trained for another 400 billion tokens, thereby saving the equivalent of up to 2T tokens of compute. Other works such as MiniCPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hu et al., 2024)</ref>, Qwen2 <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2024a)</ref> and reportedly Mixtral <ref type="bibr">(Cai, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Jiang et al., 2024</ref>) have adopted sparse upcycling but only share limited information about their configuration.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">B2</ref>, we compare sparse upcycling OLMo-1B (0724) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Groeneveld et al., 2024)</ref> with training an MoE from scratch. We find that after 500B tokens, an otherwise equivalent MoE trained from scratch already catches up with the upcycled model both on the metrics in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">B2</ref> and our additional metrics at https://wandb.ai/ai2-llm/olmoe/reports/ Plot-Scratch-vs-Upcycle--Vmlldzo4NDIyOTc4. At around 600B tokens, the MoE from scratch starts outperforming the upcycled MoE. Thus, it only requires 25% of the compute budget of the original dense model to catch up as opposed to the 120% reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Komatsuzaki et al. (2023)</ref>. However, they use expert choice routing and study encoder-decoder models <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Raffel et al., 2023)</ref>. Meanwhile, we use token choice routing ( §4.3) and decoder-only models ( §2). Further, we upcycle a model that has already been significantly overtrained <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gadre et al., 2024)</ref>, i.e., a 1B model trained for 2T tokens. Its parameters are likely already in a very optimal range for a dense model, which may limit the amount of additional exploration possible after upcycling. This motivates us to experiment with adding noise to the upcycled weights outlined in Appendix G, but we do not find it to lead to better performance. A large disadvantage of upcycling is that the upcycled MoE is constrained by some hyperparameters of the dense model. Specifically, OLMo-1B (0724) was trained without QK-Norm and normal initialization, both of which hurt stability in our experiments ( §B.2.5, §B.2.2). While it may be possible to simply add new QK-Norms and train them from scratch similar to the new router layer trained from scratch, it is impossible to change the initialization of the original dense model when upcycling it. Thus, as we want to change these hyperparameters and also train OLMOE-1B-7B for around 250% of the compute budget of the dense model (5T vs. 2T tokens), we do not use upcycling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Shazeer et al. (2017)</ref> propose the load balancing loss to penalize the model if it is unbalanced, i.e., if it routes all tokens to only a few experts. This is based on the observation that without such penalty, models tend to update only a select few experts in each layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Eigen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bengio et al., 2016)</ref>. To compute the load balancing loss (L LB ) we multiply the fraction of tokens f i routed to one expert E i with the total routing probability P i allocated to E i for one batch and sum it across the number of experts N E :</p></div>

We do not experiment with changing the weight of 0.01.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">B3</ref> we investigate the performance impact of using the auxiliary load balancing loss. We find that across training loss and validation losses, using the load balancing loss leads to better performance even after only a few billion tokens. We still measure the load balancing loss even when it is not used ("No LBL") and find that while it spikes initially, it slowly decreases over the next few billion tokens. This behavior is also visible in Figure <ref type="figure">B4</ref> (left), where initially all tokens in the first layer are assigned to the 6th expert (pink). Eventually, the model also starts assigning some tokens to the 1st expert (yellow). However, all other experts remain largely flat and are thus "dead weights" that take up GPU memory but are not used. Given these results, we use the auxiliary load balancing loss with a weight of 0.01 following prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Shazeer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Shen et al., 2024)</ref>. However, getting rid of the load balancing loss is an important direction for future research as it constrains the flexibility of the model by forcing it to use all experts approximately equally. This could prevent the experts from specializing in certain data domains and may be a reason prior work has failed to find strong evidence of expert specialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Jiang et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Zoph et al., 2022)</ref>.

In Figure <ref type="figure">B6</ref>, we compare our mix, OLMOE-MIX, with Dolma 1.7 in a controlled setup. We find that OLMOE-MIX leads to clear gains on all three downstream metrics, especially MMLU. DCLM-Baseline has been created through a series of dataset ablations targeting MMLU and other downstream metrics, which explains these results. We also compare adding Reddit and FLAN to our mix as detailed in Appendix G, but do not find consistent performance gains. We do not have a strong intuition for why adding these datasets does not help and a more automatic approach to dataset mixing may be desirable for future iterations <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Albalak et al., 2024)</ref>.

The difference between the two initializations only becomes clear at around 450 billion tokens, where the model with the normal initialization starts to diverge. This is despite both models using the same configuration except for the difference in weight initialization. Having to train for hundreds of billions of tokens until an experiment provides a clear signal is one of the key challenges of pretraining ablations. We use the truncated normal initialization for OLMOE-1B-7B.  We increase the logging interval of the RMS run at 75B tokens, hence its change in thickness.</p></div>

This is an unusual choice as most LMs use RMSNorm, such as the Llama <ref type="bibr">(Touvron et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Dubey et al., 2024)</ref>, Gemma <ref type="bibr">(Team et al., 2024b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">c)</ref>, and Qwen <ref type="bibr">(Bai et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang et al., 2024a)</ref> model families.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">B8</ref>, we observe that replacing the non-parametric layer normalization in OLMo with a parametric RMSNorm leads to better performance. This is likely because the nonparametric layer normalization leads to a large number of spikes in the gradients as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">B10</ref>. We clip gradients at 1.0, which prevents these spikes from leading to very large and potentially disruptive parameter updates. However, the clipped gradients may still harm the performance of the model as they are no longer the true gradients. Thus, despite RMSNorm lowering our training throughput by 15%, we train our final model with RMSNorm. We include the RMSNorm parameters in weight decay as we find that it performs slightly better (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">B9</ref>) even though it is common practice to exclude them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">B.2.DECAYING EMBEDDING PARAMETERS</head><p>Similar to the RMSNorm parameters ( §B.2.3), embedding parameters are commonly excluded from weight decay. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">5</ref> In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">B11</ref> we find that whether or not they are decayed has only a minor impact on performance, with decaying being slightly better. Thus for simplicity, we weight decay all parameters in OLMOE-1B-7B including embedding and RMSNorm. B.2.5 QK-NORM Some works have reported stability improvements from adding layer normalization after the query and key projections ("QK-Norm") <ref type="bibr">(Team, 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Mehta et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Dehghani et al., 2023)</ref>. QK-Norm can prevent the subsequent attention operation from leading to very large logits that may lead to numeric overflows and destabilize the network, especially when training in low precision. Like layer normalization at other places in the model, the QK-Norm could be non-parametric or use the parametric RMSNorm ( §B.2.3).</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">B12</ref>, we compare using QK-Norm with no normalization after the query and key projections. We find that QK-Norm leads to some stability and performance improvements. We perform this experiment with non-parametric layer normalization as used in OLMo <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Groeneveld et al., 2024)</ref>, while we used parametric RMS layer normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Zhang &amp; Sennrich, 2019)</ref> for OLMOE-1B-7B ( §B.2.3). To ensure the benefit of QK-Norm is not an artifact of comparing with non-parametric layer normalization, we run another experiment with RMS layer normalization and In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">B13</ref>, we find that decreasing eps to the recommended default of 1E-08 (Kingma &amp; Ba, 2017) significantly improves performance while the run remains stable.

We compare using the pretrained checkpoint prior to annealing for adaptation, using the checkpoint after the additional 100B tokens of annealing, and using the checkpoint after the additional 100B tokens of annealing and with load balancing loss ( §B.1.3) during adaptation. We apply DPO/KTO to the respective SFT model.</p><p>Human We experiment with small design choices for adaptation using our evaluation setup described in Appendix D.</p><p>(1) Auxiliary losses: Zoph et al.</p><p>(2022) find that using the auxiliary load balancing loss ( §B.1.3) during regular finetuning leads to small performance gains. For instruction tuning, however, <ref type="bibr">Shen et al. (2023a)</ref> do not find conclusive evidence in favor of using the load balancing or router z-loss with only small differences in performance, both in support of and against the auxiliary losses. In Table <ref type="table">B1</ref> we display experiments with the load balancing loss during adaptation and find that not using it leads to better performance (54.0 vs. 52.8 after instruction tuning (SFT) and 57.7 vs. 57.1 after preference tuning (DPO)). One potential problem of deactivating the load balancing loss is that it may harm balance among experts and turn some into dead weights as observed during pretraining in §B.1.3. However, when measuring the load balancing loss in Table <ref type="table">B2</ref> on our SFT data ( §2), we find that the loss only increases by around 0.01% after <ref type="bibr">SFT (8.250 vs. 8.249)</ref>. This is likely because which experts certain tokens get routed to is determined early during pretraining, as we find later in the analysis section ( §5.1). We also visualize the activation patterns of experts of the model after pretraining, and the models after SFT and DPO trained without load balancing in §H.2 (Figure <ref type="figure">H6</ref>) finding that the distribution remains around the same. Thus, as our models adapted without load balancing perform better and we find it not to impact routing substantially, we do not use load balancing during adaptation .</p><p>(2) Annealing checkpoint: We also experiment with using the checkpoint pre-annealing ( §2) for adaptation and find the checkpoint post-annealing leads to better performance (53.8 vs. 54.0 after SFT and 56.3 vs 57.7 after DPO), thus we use the post-annealing checkpoint.</p><p>(3) Preference algorithm: Since the release of DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Rafailov et al., 2023)</ref>, a variety of preference algorithms have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ethayarajh et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Hong et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Meng et al., 2024)</ref>.

We find that after 700 billion tokens, the no noise variant still performs slightly better but both appear to converge to the same performance. If training further, it is possible that the noise variant eventually outperforms the no noise variant, but at that point, it may make more sense to just train the MoE from scratch ( §B.1.2). Shared Layer Some work has investigated Mixture-of-Experts with weights shared across layers in the context of Universal Transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Tan et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Csordás et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Dehghani et al., 2019)</ref>. We test whether layer-shared Mixture-of-Experts can beat non-shared dense models in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">G4</ref>. The layer-shared MoE uses a load balancing loss that is applied at the model level rather than at the layer level. This gives the model more flexibility by allowing it to completely deactivate certain experts for some layers and even emulate a dense model by always activating one separate expert for each layer. This makes it a generalization of the dense model which motivated our hypothesis that it may perform better than the dense model. However, in practice, we find that both perform similarly with the regular dense models even maintaining a small advantage on validation loss and HellaSwag.</p><p>One possible advantage of layer-shared MoEs is that they can allow for better load balancing at inference. If prompts come in continuously, then newly incoming prompts can be batched with previous prompts that have already passed through several layers and sent through the MoE module together, as the MoE module is the same regardless of whether it is the first or last layer. Sharing also reduces throughput by around 20% during training, which further motivates our decision not to use it for OLMOE-1B-7B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KTO experiments</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">G1</ref> we experiment with the number of steps (5,000 vs. 10,000) and the optimizer (Adam (Kingma &amp; Ba, 2017) vs. RMS) used for KTO <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ethayarajh et al., 2024)</ref>. Based on these experiments we use the RMS optimizer and the checkpoint at 5,000 steps in §B.3. Router saturation We define router saturation as the proportion of expert activations at some intermediary checkpoint at time t that matches the expert IDs activated at some final checkpoint over the same dataset:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Router Saturation(t) = 1 N N ∑ i=1 |E (t) i ∩ E (T ) i | k ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where:</p><p>• N : The total number of tokens in the dataset.</p><p>• k: The number of top-k experts activated per input token. While we train with k = 8 ( §2), we also analyze k = 1 by only looking at the expert with the highest routing probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• E (t)</head><p>i : The set of k experts activated for the ith token at the tth checkpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• E (T ) i</head><p>: The set of k experts activated for the ith token at the final checkpoint T .</p><p>•</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">|E (t) i ∩ E (T ) i |:</formula><p>The number of common experts activated for the ith token between the tth and final checkpoints.</p><p>Router saturation thus corresponds to whether the router weights are still learning which expert will process certain data. A value of 100% indicates that the router at the intermediate checkpoint will route to the same experts as the final checkpoint router. However, even at 100% saturation the router weight can still change and adapt the exact router probability for each expert. These probabilities are used to scale the output of the respective expert in the model. For OLMOE-1B-7B with its 64 experts, random routing equals a saturation of 1/64 = 1.6% for k = 1 and 8/64 = 12.5% for k = 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expert co-activation</head><p>We define expert co-activation as the proportion of times two specific experts, E i and E j , are simultaneously activated out of the total number of activations of one of those experts:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Expert co-activation(E i , E j ) = N E i ,E j N E i ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where:</p><p>• E i : The first expert.</p><p>• E j : The second expert.</p><p>• N E i ,E j : The number of times experts E i and E j are activated together.</p><p>• N E i : The total number of times expert E i is activated.</p><p>A co-activation of 100% indicates that if E i is activated, E j is also always activated. A value of 0% indicates that the experts never co-occur. If multiple expert pairs have high co-activation, it may suggest that these experts could be merged, benefiting less from keeping them separate.</p><p>In a distributed setup, we could place highly co-activated experts on the same device to reduce communication costs during model inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain specialization</head><p>We define domain specialization as the proportion of tokens from a particular domain D that get routed to a particular expert E i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Domain specialization(E i , D) = N (k) E i ,D N D ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where:</p><p>• E i : The ith expert in the model.</p><p>• D: The domain from which the data originates.</p><p>• k: The number of experts considered (e.g., k = 8 means considering the top 8 experts with the highest routing probabilities).</p><p>• N</p><p>E i ,D : The number of tokens from domain D for which E i is among the top-k selected experts.</p><p>• N D : The total number of tokens from domain D processed by the MoE. Domain specialization thus refers to the specialization of expert E i to domain D. A value of 100% indicates that all data from that domain is routed to E i , whereas 0% indicates the expert is never used for that domain and can be removed from the model without affecting performance in that domain.</p><p>Vocabulary specialization We define vocabulary specialization as the proportion of tokens with a token ID x (also called vocabulary element) that are routed to one particular expert E i out of all experts in that layer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Vocabulary specialization(E i , x) = N (k) x,E i N x ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where:</p><p>• E i : The ith expert in the model.</p><p>• x: The token ID being analyzed.</p><p>• k: The number of experts considered (e.g., k = 8 means considering the top 8 experts with the highest routing probabilities).</p><p>• N x,E i : The number of times input data is routed to E i for x.</p><p>• N x : The total number of times input data is routed across all experts for x.  We visualize how often tokens from our instruction tuning dataset ( §2) get routed to the 8 active experts out of the 64 total experts (k = 1 in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>). Horizontal gray lines correspond to uniform routing (8/64=12.5% per expert). Although we run SFT and DPO without loss balancing loss ( §B.3), we observe that the load distribution does not change substantially. The size of each rectangle is proportional to the total number of tokens an expert receives, while the flow between two experts shows the proportion of tokens routed to both experts. The flows between layers 0 → 7 and 7 → 15 are independent in this visualization.</p><p>Model usage on laptops Laptops commonly have around 16GB of RAM, thus 7B parameters corresponding to 14GB in 16-bit precision perfectly fit into most laptop's RAM. With the speed of 1B parameters, the configuration of OLMOE-1B-7B could make it an ideal local assistant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model usage on phones</head><p>We have been able to run OLMOE-1B-7B on an iPhone by quantizing the model to 4-bit after which it requires around 3.5GB (0.5 * 7) of RAM. This is just below the 5GB RAM limit that is commonly imposed for an iOS app<ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">18</ref> leaving 1.5GB of RAM for other functionalities of the app. Thanks to the 1B active params OLMOE-1B-7B runs very fast on smartphones; we were able to run it at 110 tokens/second on an iPhone 16. This enables applications that might not make sense with larger and slower models, such as having the model quickly read multiple long files and summarize them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>K LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We highlight four key limitations with this release of OLMOE-1B-7B. We look forward to addressing these issues in future iterations of OLMOE.</p><p>More parameters OLMOE-1B-7B has 7B total parameters out of which 1B are activated for each input token. This small size makes OLMOE-1B-7B very cheap to use, yet we demonstrate in this work that it outperforms much more expensive models (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). We provide further reasons for this precise configuration in Appendix J. However, using only 1B parameters for each input token also limits the capabilities of OLMOE-1B-7B as seen by its performance compared to models that use &gt;7× more parameters, such as Llama3.1-8B in §3. While it may be possible that more parameters are not needed to match 8B models and beyond <ref type="bibr">(Karpathy, 2024)</ref>, in the short-term adding parameters is an easy way to improve the performance of OLMOE. Significantly adding parameters may, however, make dropless routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gale et al., 2022)</ref> as used in this work more challenging and may require expert parallelism <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Lepikhin et al., 2020)</ref> with token dropping. We note that the DBRX model also uses dropless routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Databricks, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gale et al., 2022)</ref> at a scale of 36B active and 132B total parameters. A different approach to more parameters could be allowing the model to utilize more than 1B parameters per input, possibly via recursion <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Dehghani et al., 2019)</ref> or agentic workflows <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang et al., 2024b)</ref>. Relatedly, changing the allocation of parameters to e.g. vocabulary versus non-vocabulary parameters is another avenue for improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">(Tao et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>More data We train OLMOE-1B-7B for 5 trillion tokens, however, some recent dense models train significantly longer, such as Llama 3 with 15 trillion tokens <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Dubey et al., 2024)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no large MoE that has been overtrained <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gadre et al., 2024)</ref> as much as OLMOE-1B-7B. Specifically, taking the active parameters of OLMOE-1B-7B, our token multiplier <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gadre et al., 2024)</ref> is around 5,000 (5T / 1B). There are likely benefits to training even longer, but to what degree overtraining is effective for MoEs and how it differs from dense models still requires more research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Allen-Zhu &amp; Li, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Multimodal OLMOE-1B-7B is a text-only large language model, thus it cannot take inputs or produce outputs in other modalities like images or audio. This limits its utility for the large variety of multimodal use cases of such models <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Huang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Su et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Chen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Kiela et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Muennighoff, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Radford et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bai et al., 2023b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Driess et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Dubey et al., 2024)</ref>.

This may severely limit the usefulness of our model for research on non-English language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Lovenia et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Singh et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Üstün et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Enevoldsen et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Son et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Xiao et al., 2023)</ref>.

We group them into experiments on settings specific to Mixtureof-Experts ( §B.1), experiments on settings applicable to both dense LMs and MoEs ( §B.2), and adaptation experiments ( §B.3). In pretraining experiments, we often use MMLU Var, a version of MMLU(Hendrycks et al., 2021a)  with varying few-shots and a different format that provides signal earlier during training. We describe our full evaluation setup in Appendix D and provide additional experiments in Appendix G. Each experiment links to a Weights &amp; Biases report with more validation and downstream results, and the full configurations of the runs. To isolate the impact of changes and minimize confounders, we vary only one hyperparameter for each experiment. Nevertheless, due to the large number of hyperparameters, some results may change under different configurations and we cannot guarantee the correctness of each of our hyperparameter choices. Models are not comparable across different experiments, as we vary the base model to incorporate successful findings.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="3">B.1 MOE-SPECIFIC PRETRAINING SETTINGS</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">B.1.1 SHARED EXPERTS</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">3.0 Training loss</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>2.8</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>2.6</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>2.4</cell><cell>10 40 70 100130</cell><cell>10 40 70 100130</cell></row></table></figure>

In Figure <ref type="figure">G3</ref>, we experiment with Vocabulary specialization thus refers to how specialized a particular expert is on some vocabulary item. We distinguish input and output variants of this specialization, where x is either the input token ID or the next output token ID (either the ground-truth next token ID or the token ID predicted by the model). A value of 100% indicates that for all occurrences of that vocabulary element, input data is routed to E i , whereas 0% indicates an expert that is fully irrelevant for that vocabulary element and can be effectively removed from the model without affecting performance whenever the token ID appears.   . We visualize how often token IDs get routed to specific experts. We only include IDs that appear at least 8 times in the various corpora. Vertical gray lines correspond to uniform routing (8/64=12.5% for OLMOE-1B-7B as it has 64 experts, 8 of which are activated; 2/8=25% for Mixtral as it has 8 experts, 2 of which are activated). For example, among all token IDs in GitHub that get routed to Expert 0 at least 8 times for OLMOE-1B-7B, ∼40% of them get routed to Expert 0 with a probability of ∼100% (upper left) indicating that Expert 0 is specialized on those token IDs. For OLMOE-1B-7B there is much frequency at the routing probability extremes (0% or 100%) indicating that these experts exclusively focus on certain token IDs, especially for specific domains ( §5.3) like GitHub and arXiv. We visualize how often tokens from different domains get routed to the 64 (OLMOE) or 8 (Mixtral) experts at the end of pretraining. Unlike in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, here we only consider tokens routed to the top-1 expert (k = 1 in Equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>). Horizontal gray lines correspond to uniform routing (1/64=1.56% per expert for OLMOE-1B-7B and 1/8=12.5% for Mixtral). </p></div>

We visualize how often tokens from different domains get routed to a pair of experts across layers under top-1 routing, corresponding to Figure <ref type="figure">H7</ref>. The size of each rectangle is proportional to the total number of tokens an expert receives, while the flow between two experts shows the proportion of tokens routed to both experts. We only show experts that receive tokens 50% above random chance and use stronger coloring for larger flows. We observe some instances of cross-layer coordination between pairs of experts, e.g., expert 27 in layer 7 and expert 57 in layer 15 process a substantial fraction of Wikipedia tokens together. The flows between layers 0 → 7 and 7 → 15 are independent in this visualization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J SELECTING THE NUMBER OF TOTAL AND ACTIVE PARAMETERS</head><p>In addition to what we mention in §4.1, there are three key reasons we select a configuration of 1B active parameters and 7B total parameters for OLMOE-1B-7B.</p><p>Model training 7B total parameters allow for full-parameter training on a single GPU. Specifically, our model can be trained on one 80GB VRAM GPU (e.g. A100 or H100) as it requires around 70GB of memory for training the model in 16-bit with an 8-bit optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Anthony et al., 2023)</ref>. This makes the model significantly more accessible to researchers who are often constrained by a single GPU and also bypasses the need for more complicated distributed training across multiple GPUs. A slightly larger model (e.g. JetMoE-2B-9B) may no longer fit under this setup.</p><p>constraints <ref type="bibr">(Muennighoff et al., 2023b)</ref>. This may make future OLMOE models perform better in non-English languages.</p><p>L OLMOE-1B-7B-0125</p><p>We introduced OLMOE-1B-7B in September 2024. In January 2025, we released a better model, OLMOE-1B-7B-0125, which we discuss here. We compare OLMOE-1B-7B-0125 with OLMOE-1B-7B In Table <ref type="table">L2</ref>. Overall, the new model is a notable improvement over the previous iteration being better on average (+1.6) and notable datasets like MMLU (+2.1).</p><p>Following this improved annealing setup, we adapt OLMOE-1B-7B-0125 using the post-training from Tülu 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Lambert et al., 2025)</ref>. This recipe represents an updated version of the one originally used for OLMOE. It features an improved SFT mix, better sampled DPO data, and a PPO step that leverages verifiers as for the model reward. We compare this new iteration using the evaluation setup from Tülu (which differs from other evaluations in this paper) in Table <ref type="table">L3</ref>. After adaptation, the new model is significantly better, with a 10-point gain on the benchmark average.</p><p>The new models and datasets are freely available on the Hugging Face hub. 20 For more information about this release, we refer to its announcement on Ai2's website. </p></div>			</div>
